Develop a Java utility that reads three specific Java files named File1.java, File2.java, and File3.java from the current directory. The utility should extract comments associated with each method in these files and print these comments alongside their corresponding method signatures. The output should display the information for each file separately, ensuring that the extracted data from each file is clearly delineated. The program should handle and report any errors encountered while reading the files.
